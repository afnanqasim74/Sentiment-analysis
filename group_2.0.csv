https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001MBLNU2,Dan Post Men's Albuquerque Black Size: 9.5 X-Wide,Lucas A Vaughn,Quality design has been exchanged for quick profit. Sorry I gotta move on to a new brand.,"I've been buying dan post albuquerque boots for several years now and they have been great until now. They have obviously changed the manufacturing to a much lower quality. I usually plan on buying a pair every year. I use my boots pretty hard in the garage for welding and fabricating and so far the albuquerque has taken the beating gracefully. But as soon as I opened the box for the new pair I immediately noticed the difference in quality. I included pictures of the old boot compared with the new one. The heal used to have layers of leather between the layers of sole material (rubber, plastic, poly-blablabla whatever?) It was tacked in to place and provided a sturdy support. The new boot has a chunk of foam like garbage the same as any pair of cheap garbage boot one could buy at Walmart. But they compensate for it by coloring it to look like layers of leather. I did try them on and they just didn't feel the same. The sturdy support I have come to count on has been replaced by a feeling of cheap low quality design compromises in exchange for quick profit. With a history of plantar fasciitus I just can't take the chance of wearing low quality footwear.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001MBLNU2,Dan Post Men's Albuquerque Black Size: 9.5 X-Wide,J,Update: Comfy if you can get them on.,I read a review before buying these where the guy noted that he had difficulty getting his heal down into the boot and as a result the fabric at he bottom of the shaft and the top of the heal cup tore.  Dan Post apparently fixed that problem buy adding a leather reenforcement. When I first put them on the left one went on fine but with the right one I had a good deal of difficulty getting my heal past the leather patch and into the heal cup.  It has gotten progressively worse until now I can not get the right one on no matter how hard I try.  Perhaps a boot horn would help but...anyway great boots if you can get them on. Very comfortable.  Not sure what to do at this point...So I contacted amazon and I am returning the original pair.  They sent out a new pair. This is an entirely different boot.  They are at least 1/2 too small.  MUCH narrower especially when viewed form the bottom. The sole is 1/2 narrower.  The Dan Post Tag is a different color (green and yellow as opposed to the black and gold of the original).  The heal seems higher.  Leather is inferior. Weird.  I called Dan Post and they said they are always making design changes.  Looks like I'm just going to get my money back.

So I've been on the hunt for a new pair and I came across these. I liked that the style was similar to what I already have and I liked that the sliver straps were sparkly. Totally up my alley. They look exactly as shown. They shipped pretty much right away. It didn't take long to receive them. When I got them I tried them on and the ""fit"" but unfortunately even though I ordered these in my size the material that they are made with probably wasn't the greatest choice because I can see the outline of my foot with the shoe on.

Shoes, 4.5 UK Wide, Stone Combi",Nicole,Not friendly to custom orthotics,"I purchased these for the rocker sole to help with Hallus Rigidus, swapped out the insole for my custom orthotic and tried them on.  They were quite snug.  I assumed (my first mistake) that they would stretch, and wearing them around the house for a bit with the tags on they did seem to loosen.  So off came the tags and I wore them out.Unfortunately that tiny bit was all they stretched and they remained far too tight across the vamp.  In particular, the liner crosses over the top of the foot under the elastic and forms a painful pressure point.  Since I now had $140 of unreturnable shoe, I preformed shoe surgery and removed the stitching across the top in that section. This let the liner stretch slightly, but not enough.  Even in my older, thinner orthotics and trouser socks, the pressure point remains when you wear them for any length of time.  I may yet perform more surgery to remove the liner from the toe area, because they are unusable for me in their current fit.Clark shoes run a bit small and narrow, in my experience, so I ordered half a size up and regular instead of narrow width.  This portion fit as expected.  If you do not need to swap out the insoles and so not need lateral support, these shoes might work for you.

The laces are thick. The leather feels like quality. Should be good right? Not so much. I'm 14 days in and I'm writing this with sore feet. Instead of writing you a story, I'm just going to list the problems with these boots...1) Memory foam is too thin, results in zero cushioning on hard surface while making your feet sweat profusely.2) No arch support. The inside is flatter than dollar store dress shoes.3) No side to side support. This means your heel will move, and since they are light and flexible, you'll likely roll your ankle.-All this can be solved with buying a nice insert from Sof Sol, like I did... except there is still one more COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE problem.4) Small cracks in the sole. Yes, water can leak up through the bottom of this boot between the tread resulting in wet feet (I hope that was water...) At least I didn't slip in it.There is one really big positive these though... The top of the boot, where it meets your shin and calf is really nice. There is nothing sharp or rough edged to make that uncomfortable in the slightest.

I cannot recommend these shoes because they just become too hot.  The heat results in excessive sweating and the shoes smell bad as a result.  Find another pair.  Reducing review to two stars.-----------Original review:I ordered these Merrell Men's Moab fST Waterproof Hiking Shoes to replace a set of Keen hiking shoes that I had worn out.  The Keens are excellent shoes and very comfortable, but they tend to get extensive wear on the soles (particularly for me, the heels wear out within 9 mos).  This review is my initial impression and I will update if anything changes.FIT:  The shoes fit as expected.  They seem a bit tighter than the Keen equivalent but are as expected for the size.COMFORT: These waterproof shoes get hot and are hotter than the Keen equivalent waterproof shoe.  The foot bed is definitely not as good as the Keen, probably the most notable difference.WATERPROOF: So far, so good.  I had to wade into shallow water and my feet were dry until the water got deep enough to overtop the shoe.OVERALL QUALITY: I have high hopes that the heel on this shoe will not wear as quickly.  Quality of the shoes seems very high.I rate these shoes as 4 stars out of 5, with the subtraction coming for the less comfortable foot bed than the competition and the lessened breathability resulting in more heat in the foot.

Firstly, the shoe has a serious design flaw.  The laces are sewn in place and not replaceable!  The laces wrap all the way around the heel, as a real moccasin would, but they are sewn in at the heel.  If your lace wears out, as mine did, the shoe is worthless.  The first time this happened, New Balance was kind enough to replace the shoe.  The second time, the shoe was  pretty well worn out, so I just bought a new pair.  That's when I discovered the second problem.  After only wearing the shoe a week (a week!) the leather ripped out along the stitching near the base of the tongue on the left shoe.  OK, no problem, I returned the shoe to Amazon and got another pair.  The 2nd pair popped a stitch at the same place on the right shoe BEFORE I GOT THE SHOE ON MY FOOT!!

I didn't pay enough attention to that and that was my big mistake. You can see on the pictures how the lace look like after just 5 bouldering sessions. It's almost totally ruined on the left shoe and started to tear on the right one.This is especially surprising as I do not tie shoes tightly (they're 3 sizes smaller).Obviously it's too late to return them now after 1.5 months and visible signs of usage (is it even possible to have no such signs on climbing shoes?)Later I found out that this issue is so common for La Sportiva Solutions that some shoe repairs even have a separate price for replacing laces on this particular model.
