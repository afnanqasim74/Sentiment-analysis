Maybe avoid in general!!!,"Don’t waste your time with these.  So I bought the boots in October of 2019.  Yes they are very comfortable and light, but my boots tore right  where the black part of the bottom seams to the shoe. It’s the area where the foot would flex as you step.  I contacted Vasque Red Wing and they told me they offer a 12 month warranty on any manufacturer defects. Sounds great! They told me they have a defect contract with Amazon to take care of this.  So I then reach out to amazon and they tell me that I’m past my 30 days and that they would pro rate me part of the refund and I would keep the boots and get them fixed myself. Sounds great, but that didn’t happen either, they send me a return label and will refund me 80% of the boot value because it’s considered a late return.  Failure from both companies. The 12 month warranty means nothing from Vasque and Amazon did nothing to help. My suggestion is to buy directly from a retailer. Then you may have a chance with the boot warranty.  It’s a tough pill to swallow for 4 month old boots that are $100+.Update:1/30/2020-  apparently Vasque is having issues with Amazon honoring their 12month defect contract.

I'm so disgusted that THESE BOOTS R SO FAKE! It's TOTALLY obvious to the naked eye, u just can't tell from their pic. Real Timbs r much heavier, have 4 rows of stitching (instead of 2, nice try) & r of better quality (leather/suede/nubuck) & also weatherproof. I'm not sure what fabric these r made of but it's cheap and the ones I received all appear to b wiped off which is weird because I ordered 3 pair from 3 different groups: toddler, little kids & big kids. Maybe if this were my first time owning a pair i could've been fooled but then again they're so cheaply made I strongly doubt it! I foolishly purchased these even after seeing another reviewer have a complaint of their boots separating after just 2-3 wears; I just thought maybe that individual pair was defective. I should've known better since Ive ALWAYS paid way more for ALL of my other Timbs. I just saw the price & thought they were too good of a deal to pass up especially since Timberlands prices have skyrocketed ridiculously this past year. I spent slightly less than $160 on 3 pair of these so I initially saved about $80-$100 total but what's the point when I'm gonna end up spending more to replace them when they fall apart?! I'm disappointed because I anxiously awaited my package for nearly a week and crap is what arrived. If u have never owned Timberland boots before then I suggest u go to an authorized store that sells them so u can at least feel & see what type of boot U should b receiving when ordering online. If u have Timbs then it won't take u but a second to spot these knockoffs. I received the 3 pair that I purchased for my loved ones today and 3 pair r going rite back TODAY!!!!!!!

New Balance sells them as a fantastic walking shoe.  The reviews rated this model with 4 to 5 stars and lots of positive feedback.  My intention was to get something comfortable to wear on a future trip to Germany where we expected  to do a lot of walking. I thought I had finally found what I was looking for......but unfortunately, they are not even close to comfortable.  At first I thought that I had to ""break them in"" so I was patient and kept wearing them for a 2 mile walk about 5 times since I purchased them.

I think Clark's has slipped a bit on the quality control of this model though.  The first pair that came fit fine.  They felt good, but before even 30 days expired, the metal loop that holds the back strap to the side broke clean off.  No problem, everyone can have a bad day, right?As expected the return process was clean and easy.  I re-ordered the same model thinking I had a bad apple and they came very quickly.I decided I'd loosen the back strap up a little, just in case I was putting too much pressure on the metal loop.  Nope!  Within three weeks, the same thing happened.  This is clearly a poor design.I still like Clark's.  But they have a clunker here.  I do NOT recommend this product.",1.0,True,2020-09-10,2.0,34047bf7-748c-5dae-8a29-588f05de2fdc,24/12/2021 02:29:35,ive wearing kind clark sandal 20 year think clark slipped bit quality control model though first pair came fit fine felt good even 30 day expired metal loop hold back strap side broke clean problem everyone bad day rightas expected return process clean easy reordered model thinking bad apple came quicklyi decided id loosen back strap little case putting much pressure metal loop nope within three week thing happened clearly poor designi still like clark clunker recommend product,2020-09
