Good quality components.  However, as other reviewers have said, the insole makes wearing these shoes impossible.  The surface of the insoles is some attractive suede fabric which looks like it will be very comfortable.  In fact, the fabric prevents your foot from sliding into the shoe.  I forced my feet in and my toes were uncomfortably turned in on them selves, I could not possibly wear these shoes like that.  I tried stockings and different types of socks with the same difficulty, I just could not push my foot smoothly into the shoe.  Then I tried taking the insole out of another pair of sneakers and putting them in the Aragon’s.  My foot slid right in but when I walked there was no arch support.

I appreciate how the entire sole is rubber and not mostly foam like other kids' sneakers. The sizing (like other sneaker companies) is strange. I usually purchase one or two sizes bigger than what my kids wear in most other shoes. My kids also gravitate to the ""wide"" width even though they don't have wide feet. Those last two things are specific to my kids and how they fit in the sneakers, but once I figured these out, we were set.The reason for the 3 star rating: After cutting the tag off these sneakers and discarding the box when my son gave them the thumbs up, I realized the laces are FIXED and UNADJUSTABLE. There is no way to loosen or tighten them because the tops of the laces are glued to the shoe!After wearing them for a couple days, my son commented on how loose they felt. The elastic is not hefty and they already started to lose elasticity. It would not take much time for them to become way too loose.Finally, I had no choice but to cut the elastic laces out and replace them with different laces. It was still problematic because the top hole (where the original ones were glued) was unusable for the new laces. The sneakers are still somewhat loose because my son can't lace and cinch the new laces as high as he should be able to.Bottom line: these sneakers turned out to be a mess.

G.,Sizing chart is off--these are way too small,"I got these shoes for my daughter in middle school who is taking a social dance class. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on them because it's only a one-semester class, and she is not going to need them after that. These seemed like a good deal, so I carefully measured her feet and used the sizing chart to order a size 6.5--even though she wears between a size 8-9  street shoe. Her feet are a little on the wide side, but not wide enough that she can't wear 'regular' (non-wide width or 'B' width) shoes. When these shoes came, they were size 7 (not the 6.5 I ordered), but it didn't even matter because the shoes were several sizes too small. She could cram her feet into them after several minutes of struggling, but it was easy to see that the straps dug into her skin and her toes were off the edge. I sent them back. I wanted to order a size 8, but the style she had to have for her class (brown color and 2.5-inch heel) was not available (sold out/backordered). I didn't have time to order something else from Amazon (even with 2-day shipping) and wait for it to be delivered, so I ended up going to a local dance store and spending A LOT more money on something that she could try on that was approved for her class. She also needed heel guards, which were easy to find at the local store, but almost impossible to try to determine the right size and shape for this dance shoe on Amazon.
