Comfort Winner-X Men's Therapeutic Diabetic Extra Depth Shoe: 10 X-Wide (XW/6E) White,james d. thomas,Not wide enough,Shoes seem excellent quality; sturdy and supportive and well made. Unfortunately the width runs a bit small. A small block inserted in the toe showed the width just over 1/2 inch narrower than 2 other brands.

   We are creatures of habit and I got on here to purchase my usual pair of running shoes. Since the pain in my knee was more often that tells me it’s time to replace the running shoes. These were off to the side as a recommendation so I checked them out after reading the reviews and watching the video I thought I would give them a try. I have a torn meniscus and arthritis in my left knee and the support sounded appealing. So glad I did!!!
