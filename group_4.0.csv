https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001MBLNU2,Dan Post Men's Albuquerque Black Size: 9.5 X-Wide,Bj S.,super nice but heel fits weird,"These are comfortable and cushy in the foot. The toe box is narrow at first but you can use a cedar shoe tree to make room in the toes, to open the toe area for a better fit.  I wear a women's 8.5 and the men's size 7 fit well w/ an added 3/4 insert to fill up the space in the heels and add support. These would be great for winter, with the sturdy rubber soles with tread, and warm lining. But the heels were placed at an odd angle on these, so that I kept rocking back on the heels.  I put them on a table and saw the heels do not sit flush on a flat surface. This caused the front part of the heel to dig into the bottom of my foot when wearing, and I was constantly rocking back on the heels.I think this was a defect, so returned them. I read reviews that they now make these with a cheaper 'brushed or suede' type leather,  in the past they were made with a smooth leather, so the boots are no longer an ""oily brown"" as described, but more a reddish brown suede.  I noticed the boots suede leather wrinkled quickly just in trying them on, and I was not nuts about that. One way to fix that is to apply mink oil or red wing leather cream, and this smooths out the nap so they have a smooth leather finish and not suede. Boot manufacturers are swapping out this 'nappy brushed leather or suede' for real smooth leather on many boots, b/c it must be cheaper. Sad b/c the smooth leather looks better and wears longer.",4.0,True,2021-09-19,,95aa85b1-7a17-53aa-b913-3a44d53f3d22,24/12/2021 02:26:30,comfortable cushy foot toe box narrow first use cedar shoe tree make room toe open toe area better fit wear woman 85 men size 7 fit well w added 34 insert fill space heel add support would great winter sturdy rubber sol tread warm lining heel placed odd angle kept rocking back heel put table saw heel sit flush flat surface caused front part heel dig bottom foot wearing constantly rocking back heelsi think defect returned read review make cheaper brushed suede type leather past made smooth leather boot longer oily brown described reddish brown suede noticed boot suede leather wrinkled quickly trying nut one way fix apply mink oil red wing leather cream smooth nap smooth leather finish suede boot manufacturer swapping nappy brushed leather suede real smooth leather many boot bc must cheaper sad bc smooth leather look better wear longer,2021-09

From mud to motorcycles in the snow and rain, these boots have done all I've asked and more.  In fact they're still going and I can't stand not wear them because they're incredibly comfortable and just get better looking the more beat up they get.

Light weight and versatile,"I am a full time vegetable farmer and my shoes have to go through some serious work throughout the season! For the past three months I’ve had these boots and I’ve really loved them. They’ve got a nice tread that I’m kept quite stable walking on rough terrain all day, but they don’t cake quite so heavily with mud when I am working in wet soil.Like any boot that isn’t a rubber rain boot, they will get moist in the inside if I’m really soaking them in puddles and such, but on wet mornings they stay quite dry when I’m walking through dewy grass. I still usually wear Muck boots in those conditions though.The best thing about these boots is their weight and flexibility. My feet and legs really enjoy the sneaker-like feel to these and I can wear them all day and not feel like I’ve got lead weights on my feet.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07VFW4F9F,Merrell ALVERSTONE WP,VWT,More athletic Hiker than the Moab 2s,"Coming from a Moab Vent and Moab 2 Vent user, I was a bit skeptical that any other Merrell could provide the same comfort, but man do these things rock!.I have wide and flat feet so my shoe choices are somewhat limited. I originally chose the Moab Vents because of their out-of-the-box bang-on comfort and fit (you could buy those at the store and head directly to the trail head, they were that good). As I got more educated on what makes a good hiking shoe, I started to notice that my Moabs were a little too stiff and honestly didn't cinch down enough for my ankles (They always felt loose on me, going down half a size didn't help).After my Moab 2s finally cried Uncle, I looked for a bit more athletic hiker, not a Trail Runner, but something more streamlined with a bit less of a profile and footprint. I came across the Alverstones and after reading countless reviews, I saw the magic words, ""Large Toebox"" and ""Great for wide feet"". I got them delivered and threw them on for a quick 3-miler on varied terrain, and I gotta say these are my new hiking shoes. The fit is on a another level, so much more secure than the Moab 2s, and the footprint is just streamlined enough to where I don't feel boxy and like I'm wearing hiking boots (The Moab footprint was a bit too big for my taste). The quick-lacing system cinches down securely and the design of the tread allows for fast-paced hikes, which is what I enjoy.I do agree with others that the insole needs to be swapped out ASAP, especially for someone like me with my foot issues, not a problem as I just swapped out the aftermarket insoles I had in my Moab 2s.It's only been one hike, but I love them so far and don't see any issues coming up in the future.",4.0,True,2020-11-16,10.0,243bb397-40b4-5a29-98d3-5b603d279d6d,24/12/2021 02:26:41,coming moab vent moab 2 vent user bit skeptical merrell could provide comfort man thing rocki wide flat foot shoe choice somewhat limited originally chose moab vent outofthebox bangon comfort fit could buy store head directly trail head good got educated make good hiking shoe started notice moabs little stiff honestly didnt cinch enough ankle always felt loose going half size didnt helpafter moab 2 finally cried uncle looked bit athletic hiker trail runner something streamlined bit le profile footprint came across alverstones reading countless review saw magic word large toebox great wide foot got delivered threw quick 3miler varied terrain got ta say new hiking shoe fit another level much secure moab 2 footprint streamlined enough dont feel boxy like im wearing hiking boot moab footprint bit big taste quicklacing system cinch securely design tread allows fastpaced hike enjoyi agree others insole need swapped asap especially someone like foot issue problem swapped aftermarket insole moab 2sits one hike love far dont see issue coming future,2020-11

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07G122JP7,ALLY UNION MAKE FORCE Mens Womens Walking Shoes Lightweight Mesh Slip-on Running Sneakers Gray Size: 8 Women/7 Men,MotherOfDachshunds,An honest review from a Shoe Addict.,"The sizing chart is wierd because it's Unisex Sizing. My foot is 9""x3"" and according to the listing's size chart, I should order a Men's 5/Woman's 6. However, I'm a US Woman's Size 7/7.5 and can wear a Men's 5.5/6.Since this seller offers free returns, I went ahead and ordered the recommended Size 6 (in case the sizes were Men's) and a Size 7 (in case the sizes were Woman's) so I could compare fit.The Size 6 was too snug and short. The Size 7 fits well, lengthwise but is a tad wide. I kept the 7 because I wear socks and wanted to use an insole for plantars fasciitis. The shoes do not come in a box, they come in a nice little bag - which makes them perfect for Returing the Size 6 was as easy as taking the unpacked shoe bag to Kohl's (although, since I have a printer, I chose to drop it off at UPS in the original reusable Amazon bag).A previous reviewer mentioned that they broke their ankle wearing these shoes. I can see how that could happen because the 3D-Knit weave of this particular shoe is very pliable and soft. Literally, the shoe upper feels like a loose fitting sock your Grandma might crochet. The collar of the shoe is so flimsy, a hard kick would likely send the shoe flying off your foot. So, it is impossible for me to imagine anyone running in this shoe or walking faster than 10-15 mins per mile. There simply is not enough structure to the body of the shoe for any type of performance activity. These shoes are not in the same league and will not perform at anywhere near the same level as Adidas Primeknit, Nike Flyknit or similar type of slip-on sneakers.However, it's a very comfortable, light weight shoe and perfect for casual wear and short walks. It is a great grab and go shoe and, unlike the higher end brands names, I find these to be convenient airport security shoes because they are incredibly easy on/easy off and won't make me a target for theft as I leave the airport or check into a hotel.The listing photos do not so the shoe justice. They are cute, fashionable and comfortable. I say this as a person who owns over 100 shoes at or near the $150 price point.If you plan on doing a lot of walking (over 5 miles), I'd recommend getting a good orthotics insole for arch support and heel impact (or wear a performance walking shoe instead).

Despite the heel and pad, you will feel as it you are barefoot, but that is part of the design, so buy it if that is what you are looking for.  If you want/need something rigid that will offer support all around your foot, this is NOT the shoe for you.  It is, essentially, a leather sock, with something solid underneath to withstand the wear of dancing on.  If you plan on dancing a lot and want them to last, then have a cobbler add leather or suede sole to the bottom surface (floor contact) so that they last.  For the price, just order another pair when these wear out.  The fit is comfortable, however, you will want to insert some kind of liner in the front toe section of the shoe, at the very least, if not for odor management, then for comfort. The primary reason for this is the fact the very front of the shoe, where the pads of your toes rest, has NO insole, only rippled leather (extremely uncomfortable.  The insole of the shoe falls short about 2 cm or maybe 1"" of the very tip of the front of the shoe, so the pads of your toes will press on the stictching and ribbed material where the leather shoe is sewn to the sole pad.  Look at the pictures in the description.  Where you see leather ripples/ridges in the toe area....there is no liner, sole, or pad covering this area inside the shoe.  Your toes will not be happy.  An easy, cheap solution is to purchase, trim, and insert thin shoe liners that reach all the way up to the front of the shoe, and then you will be very happy with these shoes.  They are great for practicing or even dancing (socially), but be careful that others do not step on your feet because you will have no protection for the top of your toes.

You can easily tell which version you are looking at because the US version says ""Made in the USA"" on both the tung and side of the shoe. The non-USA version is more comfortable, but less durable. Also the USA version runs about 1 size small. I enjoy wearing both about equally. The US version is better for running, the international version is more suited for walking.

I'd heard good things about Chaco sandals from multiple sources and decided to take the plunge.  Sizing charts are accurate although I found them confusing.  Best thing to do is figure out your shoe size in either centimetres or European sizing and backtrack form there.  I'm normally a size 9 in shoes, but got the size 7 Chaco per the size chart and it fits perfect.Things I've noticed:  The straps are MUCH softer and flexible than Tevas even on the parts that aren't using Velcro.  My feet appreciate that.  The sole has strong and definite arch support so if you have flat feet these might not be for you.  It's also a very wide last, which is good for my hobbit feet, but wouldn't work well if yours were long and narrow.  The foot bed is also very stiff compared to a Teva sandal which I assume means they will last a long time, but also take a few days to break in properly.For me, they fit well and are very comfy to wear.  I'm happy with the style of them as well.  I took a point off because I think they are a tad overpriced in Candada especially with the import fees being tacked on.

You kind of have to expect to get what you pay for.  Unlike other reviewers, mine did not have a smell out of the package so that was a plus!  You can however tell they are SUPER cheaply made.  The mesh fabric on the back of one of my shoes is kind of sewn/stuck together funny and it creates a crease in the back of the shoe.  There is no tongue so when you pull she shoe strings, it creates a bubble on the front of the shoe.  I normally wear a 9.5 so that's what I bought and it does feel slightly large.  They are not the ""cutest"" sneakers.  The sole is a little bulkier than what I typically go for, but if you are wearing pants, it kind of covers the bulk.  I will probably not wear them with shorts this summer.I will say, these shoes are very comfortable and so far slip resistant.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07T7HJNQW,"Clarks Men's Forge Vibe Oxford, Tan Leather, 10.5 UK",Scott P. Dailey,"They're Big, but Quality...","SIZINGFirst off, they're huge! I'm a 9.5/10 reliably. I got these in a 9, having read the many people who mistakenly bought their size only to discover these shoes are way way way oversized. Even at a 9, I was surprised at their footprint (no pun meant).When I sit them beside any other 9.5 footwear I own, these Clarks clearly tower past them. So look folks, buy 'em a half size down from what you normally wear.COMFORTStiff at first, but then, duh right? These are well-made shoes, so naturally they'll need time to open up and accommodate the nuanced geometry of your adorable feet. I've worn them now for about five hours at the office and they've already gone from, let's say, a 8 in stiffness to a 4. So, given a bit more time, they'll wear-in nicely. At first they also did made an audible ""pop"" sound, when folding at the toes as I open my stride. But again, when I say ""audible,"" I mean vaguely audible. I believe it's again related to their off-the-shelf rigidity. Once we beat on them a bit more, they'll surely become more malleable. Insole is soft and forgiving, without calling attention to itself as some kind of atom-splitting technology. I feel literally nothing invasive about these shoes. There is no ergonomics in design, for instance, that are stabbing my Achilles, or rubbing painfully against my well-moisturized, Irish-alabaster skin.APPEARANCELovely, unassuming, practical, wearable. Durable, well-built shoes, with rather understated style appointments. The stitching, for instance, around the sole is a nice rustic touch that appears durably manufactured. the bright(er) laces is a cool touch too, as it adds a nice contracting feature to their look. And the bone-colored sole is again a unsophisticated, but just declarative enough a treatment to call modest attention to them.FINAL VERDICTThey're Clarks, so there's that.

The other thing is, the tongue of the shoe tends to migrate toward the outside of the shoe, which isn't the end of the world, it just looks weird, so I'm forever re-adjusting it.

Comfort Winner-X Men's Therapeutic Diabetic Extra Depth Shoe: 10 X-Wide (XW/6E) White,joemaamah,Call the Doctor,"I deal with a lot of swelling in my feet, and neuropathic pain as well. This is my second pair of Dr. Comfort's and they have pluses and minuses over the previous pair.Pluses:Extra ""depth"" to the shoe - Most of the swelling I have is on the top of my feet, with a little less to the sides. Having this extra depth keeps my foot from feeling mooshed into the shoe, putting extra pressure on the swollen areas.Velco Straps/Tongue design - Someone actually did a little engineering here. Instead of a regular flapper of a tongue this shoe has no tongue but a separation to the side of the shoe that opens wide, allowing a lot easier access to get one's foot into the shoe without having to yank the things on over your feet. The straps make adjusting the amount of pressure to hold the foot in place highly adjustable.Minuses:Inserts - Although these come  with very high quality inserts, they aren't as comfortable as my original Dr. Comforts. Not as well padded and not as good arch support. It probably would never be noticeable though if I hadn't had the first pair to compare.Inner Padding - The insides of my originals were soft as lamb's wool. While these are fairly comfortable, they are the level of cooshiness I've come to expect.The minuses are relative though.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07PWMSXVP,ASICS Gel-Kayano 5 360 Men&#39;s Running Shoes,Scott,Great comfy pair of tennis!,"I gave these shoes 4 out of 5 stars because of the insoles.  I have sensitive feet, am on my feet quite a bit throughout the day, and have a bad back so I’m critical about my footwear and often purchase premium insoles for my most worn shoes, boots, and even my house slippers.  The shoes themselves are excellent - ASICS gel never disappoints!  These have a very breathable construction to prevent foot sweating (and future stink) that some shoes may not provide.  My feet sweat more than the average joe so I consider breathable construction critical as well.  I love the color choices and the one I chose looks great with a pair of jeans and  a t-shirt and are not a total eye catcher.  Some women with a big bust may be able to relate to this similarity.  Sure, it’s great to show off and look good, but I like a fairly modest look.  If you are looking for a great brand of tennis shoes that are durable, lasting, colorful, comfortable, and cozy, consider ASICS gel brand shoes.  For those of you with lower back pain who visit chiropractors whom do mention finding a comfortable pair of footwear and insoles, I have not tried much but the Dr. School’s branded insoles.  They have several types and the packaging is designed where a buyer can squeeze the insoles anf feel the material they are made of.  Anyway, these shoes are not the first pair of ASICS gel shoes I have owned over the years and they do not disappoint.  If I had a kid, I would bring him or her up in ASICS for sure- and perhaps some cute looking gorilla slippers or maybe even some of those shoes that resemble lizard feet and “growl” when the kids stomp their feet.  I also like Nike Air, Sketchers, and k-Swiss “tubbers”.  They are also kind to a middle-aged man wit s bit of back pain.  Lift with your knees, wear comfortable shoes, stretch a couple minutes in bed when you first wake up, don’t sit on a huge wallet that makes you bum uncomfortable, take it easy, and visit a chiropractor twice within a week when back problems become an issue and you’ll be happy.  It wouldn’t hurt getting a massage either from time to time either.  Oh, and be critical on the chairs you sit on often and adjust your automobile lumbar support properly too.  You can do a lot of little things on your own like that and they even sell automobile seat mats that massage your butt and back too.  But yeah, a good pair of shoes is top on the list and ASICS gel does not disappoint!",4.0,True,2021-07-08,,fbab4475-61bd-5130-a2c5-bc427836da82,24/12/2021 02:29:07,gave shoe 4 5 star insole sensitive foot foot quite bit throughout day bad back ’ critical footwear often purchase premium insole worn shoe boot even house slipper shoe excellent asics gel never disappoints breathable construction prevent foot sweating future stink shoe may provide foot sweat average joe consider breathable construction critical well love color choice one chose look great pair jean tshirt total eye catcher woman big bust may able relate similarity sure ’ great show look good like fairly modest look looking great brand tennis shoe durable lasting colorful comfortable cozy consider asics gel brand shoe lower back pain visit chiropractor mention finding comfortable pair footwear insole tried much dr school ’ branded insole several type packaging designed buyer squeeze insole anf feel material made anyway shoe first pair asics gel shoe owned year disappoint kid would bring asics sure perhaps cute looking gorilla slipper maybe even shoe resemble lizard foot “ growl ” kid stomp foot also like nike air sketcher kswiss “ tubbers ” also kind middleaged man wit bit back pain lift knee wear comfortable shoe stretch couple minute bed first wake ’ sit huge wallet make bum uncomfortable take easy visit chiropractor twice within week back problem become issue ’ happy ’ hurt getting massage either time time either oh critical chair sit often adjust automobile lumbar support properly lot little thing like even sell automobile seat mat massage butt back yeah good pair shoe top list asics gel disappoint,2021-07
